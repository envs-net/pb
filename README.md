**pb** is a helper utility for using 0x0 pastebin services

pb  provides  an  easy-to-use  interface  for  uploading images or piping output to a 0x0
pastebin service. While it comes pre-configured with a  specific  pastebin,  the  service
endpoint can be overridden.

## Usage Examples

Upload 'scores.txt' to the pastebin

```bash
pb scores.txt
```

Upload piped output to the pastebin

```bash
echo 'Secret info' | pb
```

Upload a list of javascript files to the pastebin individually

```bash
find . -type f -name '*.js' -print | pb -f
```

Upload a file to a different pastebin endpoint

```bash
pb -s http://0x0.st scores.txt
```

Shorten a URL

```bash
pb -u https://google.com
```

  -h                        Show this help
  -v                        Show current version number
  -f                        Explicitly interpret stdin as filename
  -c                        Pretty color output
